## What is **inode**

An **inode** (index node) is the core data structure a Unix/Linux filesystem uses to represent a file. 

* A filesystem has two parts for files:
    * Directory entries (folder entries): map a name (like notes.txt) to an inode number.
    * Inodes: store metadata and pointers to the fileâ€™s actual data blocks.

Show inode number with `ls -i`:

```
$ ls -i
68352773 astro.config.mjs	
68353985 node_modules		
68352782 package.json		
68352772 README.md
```
`stat <filename>` will give details about the `<filename>`

## GNU common options ([coreutils manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Common-options.html)):

GNU mandates that every util implements two options.

1. `--help` : Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit successfully.
2. `--version` : Print the version number, then exit successfully.

It also mandates `--` is to be treated as delimiter for the options. For eg. `sort -- -r` reads from the file named `-r`
