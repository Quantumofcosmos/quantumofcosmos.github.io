Dataset is a collection of data where the data points are arranged homogeneously and in an easily accessible way. This ordered data will usually follow a set of rules called schema which will have information about the data-type of different columns.
Following are a few famous datasets:

* [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) : Small data set illustrating the importance of graphing the data to avoid statistical fallacies (Hello world of Visualization basics Exploratory data analysis)

* [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) :  Multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936(Hello world of descriptive and predictive analysis).

* [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) : Images of handwritten digits commonly used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithms. (Hello world of Neural networks and image processing)

Dataset repository is usually a collection of datasets that are available for use.

Following are a few open-source dataset repositories:
